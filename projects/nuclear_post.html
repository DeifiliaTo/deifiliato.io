                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p id="content">
                    Nuclear power is one of the largest low-emission sources of energy in the world, 
                    producing 11.5% of the global electricity demands (Canadian Nuclear Association, 2019). 
                    Nuclear power is the third most prominent sources of power generation, 
                    lagging only behind fossil fuels and hydro (Canadian Nuclear Association, 2019). 
                    Nuclear reactors were first introduced in Canada in 1944 (World Nuclear Association, 2020). 
                    In 2008, nuclear power comprised 53% of Ontario’s electricity at the low cost of 5c/kWh.

                    Major concerns and taboos about Nuclear Energy
                </h3>
                <p id="content">
                    One of the main misconceptions about nuclear power is its safety. Public perception of nuclear safety is 
                    mostly misled by previous incidents Chernobyl and Fukushima (Macilwain, 2011). Dr. Robert Dupont, 
                    an expert on fears and phobias, has studied and analyzed social perceptions of nuclear energy. 
                    He stated that more attention is naturally given to the suffering of victims by the media (Frontline, n.d.). 
                    The vivid portrayal nuclear and its association with weapon since the Cold War has misled many to fear and 
                    reject nuclear power. Furthermore, many who oppose nuclear believe in outdated taboos and refuse to see the 
                    new scientific proofs and data (Frontline, n.d.). 
                </p>
                <p id="content">
                    Each year, countless people suffer and die from vehicle accidents, but people are not opposed to cars (Sinclair, 1998). 
                    This is because we are well aware of both the risk and benefit of driving. While the information the public hears about 
                    nuclear only relates to its risk (Sinclair, 1998). It is therefore necessary for the public to be exposed to truthful 
                    information on the benefits of nuclear power to overcome the nuclear taboos.

                <p id="content">
                    Now that we’ve talked the anecdotal (albeit dramatic) evidence underscoring the dangers of nuclear power, 
                    let’s look at the quantitative metrics. While it is undeniable that nuclear power can be deadly to humans, 
                    we also have to consider that the byproducts that arise from burning fossil fuel also has substantial negative 
                    impacts on human health. According to the WHO, urban air pollution resulting from fossil fuels kills 7 million people annually. 
                    Coal plants also release radioactive waste from smokestacks (Wilkerson, 2016).

                <p id="content">
                    We can see that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per kWh is miniscule for nuclear power—only 16 g CO2eq/kWh—in comparison with coal, which emits 820 g CO2eq/kWh.

                    When we compare years of life lost for common types of energy conversion, we can see that nuclear is 32 times less dangerous than coal, 
                    on a per-kWh basis. In this way, we can consider nuclear energy safer—statistically speaking. We must ask: should we invest in nuclear, 
                    a statistically safe source that can result in disastrous consequences, or continue with other sources, which are more dangerous in a 
                    cumulative manner, but have less chance of disaster (Hvistendahl, 2007)? 
                </p>
                <p id="content">
                    Another major concern is the storage of nuclear waste. However, these problems are often overblown. Britain’s 10 nuclear power stations 
                    create only 840 mL of nuclear waste/person/year. The comparable ash from the same amount of energy would amount to 40L/person/year (MacKay, 2015). 
                    Furthermore, only 3% of the nuclear waste is high-level waste, which drops to 0.1% of its initial radioactivity after 40 years (MacKay, 2015).  
                </p>
                <h3 id="header">How much does nuclear energy cost?</h3>
                <p id="content">
                    Nuclear energy is still relatively new and still developing. The construction of a nuclear power plant includes sophisticated safety measures, 
                    special material and advanced equipment (World Nuclear Association, 2008). Generally, the initial construction cost is much higher than coal plants. 
                    The initial cost also varies from site to site and depends on many factors such as abundancy of material and engineering (World Nuclear Association, 2008). 
                    The operating cost of nuclear plants is lower than fossil fuel operations (World Nuclear Association, 2020). The raw material uranium is a concentrated 
                    resource that can be cheaply transported; every kilograms of uranium 20,000 times as much as a kg of coal (World Nuclear Association, 2008). 
                    Besides the economic cost, the energy cost, specifically the total fuel cost of nuclear plant is only about one third of the coal-fired plant (World Nuclear Association, 2008).

                <p id="content">
                    As can be seen from Figure 4, nuclear energy has the lowest production cost. However, as nuclear energy still has a bad public impression, 
                    there is also the risk from politics and taxation (World Nuclear Association, 2020). Many places have already made nuclear power an important 
                    provider of its energy supply. In Ontario, the government and its taxpayers recognize nuclear plants’ minimal greenhouse gas emission and small 
                    land footprint (CNA,2020). The government is also committed to keeping refurbishing its reactors. Based on CNA (2020), 60% of the electricity is supplied 
                    by nuclear plants in Ontario. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="header"> Conclusion </h3>
                <p id="content">
                    All in all, we can see that nuclear energy is statistically safer than coal, but disastrous in case of an accident. We must decide the best compromise 
                    between long-term safety and assurance. Nuclear energy is more cost-efficient compared to fossil fuel despite its high initial cost. The media and government 
                    are responsible for informing the public of the benefits of nuclear energy to clear out the taboos around nuclear power and better advance nuclear energy development in the future.
